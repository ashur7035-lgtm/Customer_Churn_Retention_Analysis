## 📊 Phase 1: Excel Data Analysis & Dashboard
In this initial phase, I focused on transforming raw customer data into a management-ready interactive dashboard. This involved data cleaning, feature engineering, and creating visual insights.

### 🛠️ Key Tasks Performed:
- **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values, removed duplicates (based on CustomerID), and corrected data types for consistency.
- **Feature Engineering:** Created new segments like `AgeGroup` (Young, Adult, Senior) and `TenureGroup` (New, Medium, Long-Term) to better understand customer behavior.
- **Pivot Analysis:** Built multiple Pivot Tables to analyze churn patterns by Gender, Contract Type, Tech Support, and Internet Service.
- **Interactive Dashboard:** Developed a dynamic dashboard with Slicers for real-time filtering and KPI cards for high-level metrics.

### 📈 Dashboard Highlights:
- **Total Customers:** 1000
- **Churn Rate:** 88% (Based on the analyzed sample)
- **Insight 1:** Customers with **Month-to-Month** contracts have the highest churn risk.
- **Insight 2:** The lack of **Tech Support** is a major driver for customers leaving.
- **Insight 3:** Churned customers often had higher **Monthly Charges** compared to retained ones.
